  "01_discussionboard_overview_and_scope.md": "# Political/Economic Discussion Board: Overview & Scope\n\n## Purpose & Vision\nThe Political/Economic Discussion Board aspires to provide a robust, trustworthy online platform where users engage in insightful discourse on current political and economic affairs. By championing respectful dialogue, diverse viewpoints, and fact-based conversation, this community-centric space aims to elevate public understanding and positively impact civic participation. Our vision is to create both a forum for rich, in-depth analysis and a welcoming environment for newcomers eager to inform themselves and contribute to the public debate. Continuous enhancements, both in features and community moderation, ensure that the space adapts to evolving user needs and societal trends.\n\n## High-Level Scope\nThis platform centers on threaded discussions, open commentaries, and peer-to-peer debate structured around major topics in politics and economics. Core features include topic-specific boards, voting/liking systems, moderation tools, and content curation. Built for scalability, the discussion board maintains a balance between openness and responsible discourse, using layered access roles such as users (contributors/readers), moderators (community stewards), and admins (system managers). Fundamental security, anti-abuse, and privacy requirements are embedded, alongside configurable settings for user experience and content organization. Collaborative mechanisms, such as reporting and escalation, empower community self-management.\n\n## User Roles (Summary)\n- **User**: Can create accounts, start or join discussions, write posts and comments, like, or report inappropriate content.\n- **Moderator**: Manages posts, handles reports, moderates discussions, can restrict or ban users.\n- **Admin**: Oversees all settings, roles, user permissions, and technical aspects of the board.\n\n## Functional Requirements\nThe key functional building blocks of the discussion board are detailed below, reflecting the practical needs and business aims of the platform:\n\n1. **User Registration & Authentication**: Enable secure signup, login, and password recovery for all participants.\n2. **Thread & Post Management**: Allow users to create, edit, and delete discussion threads and posts; support hierarchical (threaded) replies.\n3. **Commenting & Community Interaction**: Provide capabilities for users to comment on threads, reply to posts, quote, like, and engage in peer evaluation.\n4. **Content Moderation Tools**: Allow moderators and admins to manage flagged or reported posts, monitor discussions, remove inappropriate content, and ban problematic users.\n5. **Permission & Role Management**: Support the defined user roles with specific access privileges; allow admins to assign/revoke roles.\n6. **Board & Topic Configuration**: Admins can create, merge, or archive topic boards and configure board-level settings.\n7. **Notification System**: Deliver timely alerts for replies, mentions, reports, and administrative actions.\n8. **Reporting & Abuse Handling**: Make it easy for users to report content, with streamlined workflow for reviewers.\n9. **Search & Navigation**: Implement advanced search, topic filtering, and tagging for easy information discovery.\n10. **Audit Logging & Analytics**: Record key events and provide reporting for admin oversight, security, and community health tracking.\n\nThese requirements collectively ensure a safe, fair, and engaging environment, providing all essential functions for users to discuss, for moderators to govern, and for admins to maintain an active, thriving community. Improvements or enhancements will follow user feedback and operational analysis.",
