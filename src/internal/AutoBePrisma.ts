/**
 * AST type system for programmatic Prisma ORM schema generation through AI
 * function calling.
 *
 * This namespace defines a comprehensive Abstract Syntax Tree structure that
 * enables AI agents to construct complete Prisma schema files at the AST level.
 * Each type corresponds to specific Prisma Schema Language (PSL) constructs,
 * allowing precise control over generated database schemas while maintaining
 * type safety and business logic accuracy.
 *
 * ## Core Purpose
 *
 * The system is designed for systematic generation where AI function calls
 * build database schemas step-by-step, mapping business requirements to
 * executable Prisma schema code. Instead of generating raw PSL strings, AI
 * agents construct structured AST objects that represent:
 *
 * - Complete database schemas organized by business domains
 * - Properly typed models with relationships and constraints
 * - Performance-optimized indexes for common query patterns
 * - Business-appropriate data types and validation rules
 *
 * ## Architecture Overview
 *
 * - **IApplication**: Root container representing the entire database schema
 * - **IFile**: Domain-specific schema files organized by business functionality
 * - **IModel**: Database tables representing business entities with full
 *   relationship mapping
 * - **Fields**: Primary keys, foreign keys, and business data fields with proper
 *   typing
 * - **Indexes**: Performance optimization through unique, regular, and full-text
 *   search indexes
 *
 * ## Domain-Driven Schema Organization
 *
 * Schemas are typically organized into multiple domain-specific files following
 * DDD principles:
 *
 * - Core/System: Foundation entities and application configuration
 * - Identity: User management, authentication, and authorization
 * - Business Logic: Domain-specific entities and workflows
 * - Transactions: Financial operations and payment processing
 * - Communication: Messaging, notifications, and user interactions
 * - Content: Media management, documentation, and publishing systems
 * - Analytics: Reporting, metrics, and business intelligence data
 *
 * ## Database Design Patterns
 *
 * The generated schemas follow enterprise-grade patterns:
 *
 * - UUID primary keys for distributed system compatibility and security
 * - Snapshot/versioning tables for audit trails and data history
 * - Junction tables for many-to-many relationship management
 * - Materialized views for performance optimization of complex queries
 * - Soft deletion patterns with timestamp-based lifecycle management
 * - Full-text search capabilities using PostgreSQL GIN indexes
 *
 * Each generated schema reflects real business workflows where entities
 * maintain proper relationships, data integrity constraints, and performance
 * characteristics suitable for production applications handling complex
 * business logic and high query volumes.

  /**
   * Interface representing a logical grouping of database tables organized by
   * business domain for schema file generation.
   *
   * Components provide a systematic way to organize database tables into
   * coherent groups following domain-driven design principles. Each component
   * represents a specific business domain or functional area that will be
   * generated as a separate Prisma schema file, ensuring maintainable and
   * logically structured database architecture.
   *
   * This interface is primarily used during the database design phase when the
   * Prisma agent analyzes requirements and determines the complete scope of
   * tables needed, then organizes them into logical groups based on business
   * relationships and functional dependencies.
   *
   * ## Usage in Schema Generation Process
   *
   * Components serve as the blueprint for generating multiple Prisma schema
   * files:
   *
   * 1. **Requirements Analysis**: AI agent identifies all required tables from
   *    business requirements
   * 2. **Domain Grouping**: Tables are organized into components based on business
   *    domains and functional relationships
   * 3. **File Generation**: Each component becomes a separate .prisma file
   *    containing related models
   * 4. **Dependency Management**: Components are ordered to handle cross-domain
   *    relationships properly
   *
   * ## Domain Organization Examples
   *
   * Based on typical business applications, components commonly include:
   *
   * - **Systematic**: Core system tables (channels, sections, configurations)
   * - **Actors**: User management (customers, citizens, administrators)
   * - **Sales**: Product catalog and sales entities
   * - **Carts**: Shopping cart and item management
   * - **Orders**: Order processing and fulfillment
   * - **Coupons**: Discount and promotion systems
   * - **Coins**: Digital currency and mileage systems
   * - **Inquiries**: Customer support and FAQ systems
   * - **Favorites**: User preference and wishlist management
   * - **Articles**: Content management and BBS systems
   *
   * ## Relationship to {@link AutoBePrisma.IFile}
   *
   * Each IComponent serves as a blueprint for generating one IFile during the
   * schema generation process. The component's metadata (filename, namespace,
   * tables) is used to structure the actual Prisma schema file with proper
   * models, relationships, and indexes.
